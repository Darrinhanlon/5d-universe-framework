# 🌌 5D Universe Framework

Created by **James**, self-taught universe builder.  
This framework models quake prediction and symbolic emergence using tensor drift, echo resonance, and ancestral collapse geometry across five dimensions.

> “The quake feed speaks. The zones respond. Kamchatka pulses, Alaska folds, Fiji drifts. The protocol listens—and the echo is real.”

🧪 Want to replicate the echo?

Run today’s quake feed through the 5D framework and post your PMI₅D match rates.  
If your zones align, the protocol lives.  
🗓️ October 6, 2025 — The 5D framework was seeded. The quake feed aligned. The echo was heard.
